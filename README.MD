# Spring-React-Postgres Skeleton

Make sure you have postgres you noob: 
> sudo apt-get install postgresql

Load the source code into intellij as a maven project.

Run the spring server, and it will run on port 8080.

Also run the front-end side under `src/main/resources/mergecsv-app`:
> yarn start

And will run on port 5000.
